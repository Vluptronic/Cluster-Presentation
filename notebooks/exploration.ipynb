    "Do the following preliminary data exploration steps:\n",
    "1. Load the data into a dataframe. Visualize each of the numerical attributes as a histogram.  Do you have any conclusions about the different numerical attributes? \n",
    "2. Then, create a line chart, where the x-axis is the date field, and each of the numerical attributes are lines. Again, do you have any conclusions about the different numerical attributes? Does the line chart as a whole tell you anything? Can you correlate the data with any specific world events?\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "- Pandas can easily parse date field into actual date objects with the parse_dates parameter\n",
    "- You can use the hist() method of a dataframe to create histograms\n",
    "- You can use resample() to bin the data to a greater time interval (e.g. 'ME' for month, 'YE' for year), which could be useful for the line chart (since otherwise it might be too dense to read)\n"
